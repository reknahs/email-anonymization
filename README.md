Bug List:

1. [COMPLETE] Anonymization for some newsletter emails takes very long (will remove links in preprocessing and reevaluate)
2. [IN PROGRESS] Labeling is relatively inaccurate (will try allowing for multiple labels)
3. [IN PROGRESS] Json file is wrong a lot of the time (will try getting the tool_calls response + further debugging)
